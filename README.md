#MegaBasic
*Mega Basic brings the BASIC programming language to an arduino mega.
*The Basic Interpreter was cloned from Jerry Williams JR https://github.com/jwillia3/BASIC
which requires more memory than the Mega can supply.
* Extra memory is provided by a 24LC256 or larger serial EEPROM  and a custom memory manager has been written to use

##Todo
	*Test, Test and more testing.
	*Currently the memory manager can store and retrive an integer or char from the eeprom.
